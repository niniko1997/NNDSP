What is in analysis_notebooks?

1. age_distributions.ipynb: This notebook tries to mimic the age distributions of NNDSP onto 
NKI or HCP on NKI and NNDSP
2. follow_up_analysis: contains code for study 'Parsimony and Data Characteristics in Machine
Learning for Neuroimaging"
3. ninos_magic_env.yml: python environment used
4. stat_tests.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with statitistical functions used in machine_learning.ipynb
5. clean_fs3t_output.ipynb: notebook that removes files of failed freesurfer subjects
6. machine_learning.ipynb: compares the complex and simple model on HCP, NNDSP and NKI   
7. other_files: contains hcp_area.csv file that I used to submit a pull request to bids/BARACUS
8. util.ipynb: additional functions that are used in the main notebook
9. continuous_complex.ipynb: notebook tries to continuously downsurf the complex model
10. ml_subsample.ipynb: code for repeating the machine learning study using only a subsample of
NNDSP data
11. phenotype_files: ontains all the csv files (with sex, age, etc) of different datasets
12. exploratory_methods.ipynb:
13. multiple_iterations.ipynb: notebook that repeats study a large number of times
